"Exposure event", "A single event during which there is continuous contact between a substance and a target. The event is normally of a short duration (less than 24 hours). The attribute \"continuous contact\" in this context means that there is no interruption of the exposure.", "Adapted from Heinemeyer et al. 2022"
"Exposure duration", "The length of time over which continuous or intermittent contacts occur between a substance and a target. For example, if an individual is in contact with an agent for 10 min, it is short term exposure. If the contact is every day for 300 days over a 1-year time period, the exposure duration is 1 year; it is long-term exposure.", "Adapted from Heinemeyer et al. 2022"
"Exposure frequency", "The number of exposure events in an exposure duration.", "Adapted from Heinemeyer et al. 2022"
"Exposure event", "A single event during which there is continuous contact between a substance and a target. The event is normally of a short duration (less than 24 hours).

"Exposure pathway", "The course a substance takes from its source to the exposed individual or population, or a part of that course. An exposure pathway involves in general one or several transfer mechanisms from emission sources to exposure sources, and/or between several related exposure sources (e.g., from soil to food).", "Adapted from EEA Glossary and EPA; and project meetings"
"Exposure route", "The way in which a substance reaches an external exposure surface, starting from the exposure source. These are oral ingestion, inhalation and dermal contact. Each exposure route is generally associated with a particular absorption behaviour through the absorption barriers surface that directly or indirectly separates the external exposure surfaces (outer or inner surfaces) from the internal exposure surfaces.", "Adapted from (IPCS and IOMC 2004); and project meetings"
"Exposure source", "The origin of substance or a mixture for the purposes of an exposure assessment, in immediate contact with outer surfaces of exposure, to which individuals in the target population may be exposed. Examples are food, drinking water, consumer products, indoor air, outdoor air, dust and soil.", "Adapted from (IPCS and IOMC 2004); (van Tongeren et al. 2011); and project meetings"
"Exposure surface", "A surface on a target where a substance is present. A distinction could be made between the surfaces inside the body, i.e. inner exposure surfaces, and those outside the body, i.e. outer exposure surfaces, that have in common to be located before an absorption barrier. Examples of outer exposure surfaces include the exterior of an eyeball, the skin surface, and a conceptual surface over the nose and open mouth. Examples of inner exposure surfaces include the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, and the urinary tract lining. Both outer and inner exposure surfaces can be called: external exposure surfaces. There are also exposure surfaces behind an absorption barrier the epithelia. These include, for example, urine, blood, or even specific organs. These surfaces can be called: internal exposure surfaces.", "Adapted from (IPCS and IOMC 2004)"
"Exposure target", "Any biological entity that receives an exposure or a dose (e.g., a human, a human population, or a human organ).", "from (Heinemeyer et al. 2022), and (IPCS and IOMC 2004)"
