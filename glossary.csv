"Absorption barrier","Adapted from (Heinemeyer et al. 2022)","","Any exposure surface that may retard the rate of penetration of a substance into a target. Examples include the skin, respiratory tract lining, and gastrointestinal tract wall."
"(Single chemical) aggregate exposure","Adapted from (Heinemeyer et al. 2022), and (OECD, IOMC 2018, p.11)","","Exposure to a single substance from multiple sources (i.e.: water, air, dust, diet, etc.) and from multiple routes (ingestion, inhalation, dermal contact)."
"Aggregate exposure assessment","From PARC A6.2.1","","Exposure assessment to one or multiple substances from multiple sources (i.e.: water, air, dust, diet, etc.) and from multiple routes (ingestion, inhalation, dermal contact). This can comprise exposures from general and occupational environments."
"Aggregate exposure model","From PARC A6.2.1","","Mathematical model whose purpose is to estimate exposure at a relevant target, modelling all relevant sources and routes. If the effect is local, then in general the relevant target is an outer exposure surface, and aggregation is carried out only at exposure source level. If the effect is systemic, then aggregation is also modelled at exposure routes level, and the target is a biological matrix."
"Aggregate oral exposure assessment","From PARC A6.2.1","","Assessment of exposure to one or multiple substances from multiple sources (i.e.: water, air, dust, diet, etc.) via ingestion. This can comprise oral exposures from general life and occupational environments."

"Exposure duration", "Adapted from (Heinemeyer et al. 2022)", "", "The length of time over which continuous or intermittent contacts occur between a substance and a target. For example, if an individual is in contact with an agent for 10 min, it is short term exposure. If the contact is every day for 300 days over a 1-year time period, the exposure duration is 1 year; it is long-term exposure."
"Exposure event", "Adapted from (Heinemeyer et al. 2022)", "", "A single event during which there is continuous contact between a substance and a target.

"Exposure pathway", "Adapted from EEA Glossary and EPA; and project meetings", "", "The course a substance takes from its source to the exposed individual or population, or a part of that course. An exposure pathway involves in general one or several transfer mechanisms from emission sources to exposure sources, and/or between several related exposure sources (e.g., from soil to food)."
"Exposure route", "Adapted from (IPCS and IOMC 2004); and project meetings", "", "The way in which a substance reaches an external exposure surface, starting from the exposure source. These are oral ingestion, inhalation and dermal contact. Each exposure route is generally associated with a particular absorption behaviour through the absorption barriers surface that directly or indirectly separates the external exposure surfaces (outer or inner surfaces) from the internal exposure surfaces."
"Exposure scenario","Adapted from (Heinemeyer et al. 2022)","","A combination of facts, assumptions, and inferences that define a discrete situation where potential exposures may occur. These may include the exposure source, the exposed target population, and the time frame of exposure, microenvironment, and activities. Scenarios are often created to aid exposure assessors in estimating exposure (WHO/IPCS, 2004)."
"Exposure source", "Adapted from (IPCS and IOMC 2004); (van Tongeren et al. 2011); and project meetings", "", "The origin of substance or a mixture for the purposes of an exposure assessment, in immediate contact with outer surfaces of exposure, to which individuals in the target population may be exposed. Examples are food, drinking water, consumer products, indoor air, outdoor air, dust and soil."
"Exposure surface", "Adapted from (IPCS and IOMC 2004)", "", "A surface on a target where a substance is present. A distinction could be made between the surfaces inside the body, i.e. inner exposure surfaces, and those outside the body, i.e. outer exposure surfaces, that have in common to be located before an absorption barrier. Examples of outer exposure surfaces include the exterior of an eyeball, the skin surface, and a conceptual surface over the nose and open mouth. Examples of inner exposure surfaces include the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract, and the urinary tract lining. Both outer and inner exposure surfaces can be called: external exposure surfaces. There are also exposure surfaces behind an absorption barrier the epithelia. These include, for example, urine, blood, or even specific organs. These surfaces can be called: internal exposure surfaces."

"Living environments","From PARC A6.2.1","","Environments where activities that are likely to expose humans to chemicals take place. A distinction is made between the occupational environment and the living environment outside of work, which is called the general environment. The exposure sources of the general environment are food, drinking water; exposure sources of the outdoor environment: outdoor air, water, lands, and other types of outdoor media; exposure sources of the indoor environment: indoor air, dust; and finally exposure sources of all types of environments encountered outside the workplace, generally related to the use of consumer products."
